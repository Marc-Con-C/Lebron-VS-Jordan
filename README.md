# MICHAEL JORDAN VS LEBRON JAMES

This project is based on the datasets provided by https://www.kaggle.com/edgarhuichen/nba-players-career-game-log and centers around the idea to find a regression model that is able to help us predict and classify both players' performances, and an implementation of the gradient descent.


Competitiveness has always been a prominent trait in people's lives. In the words of Sigmund Freud, ""Humans are born screaming for attention and full of organic drives for fulfillment in various areas". This is why it feels natural to compare and compete with each other, being athletics the star field for the matter.
    
More precisely, the purpose of this project is to compare two of the most recognized basketball players in the world: Michael Jordan, the greatest player of all time, and LeBron James, a star that is also considered one of the best players in the world. 
    
_Will LeBron James be able to catch up, or even surpass, Michael Jordan before his career ends or not?_ That is the question that we will try to answer in the following pages, utilizing different types of regressions and analysis methods on the datasets made for each player. These will include linear regressions, polynomial fits, as well as the application of an automatic PCA process and the implementation of a gradient descent.
